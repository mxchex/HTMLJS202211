        <b><i> My name is Anchor Wu, I am a non binary person by the pronouns they/he. I like to watch anime such as Spy x Family, JJBA, and Saiki K. Along with that, I also enjoy cosplaying these characters. I also enjoy cosplaying from games I enjoy. Games such as Persona 5, Valorant, and Error143. Being able to pretend to be the characters I love is a fun hobby that I show off in conventions like Comic Con.
	
        I am currently studying Game Development in NEIT and plan to head into the design pathway to become an artist for the video game world. Art is something I enjoy and have always enjoyed my whole life. Almost every career Ive wanted to pursue was a form of art. I wanted to be a hairdresser, a fashion designer, and a doll maker but I know that being a game designer is what I want to do permanently.</i></b>
